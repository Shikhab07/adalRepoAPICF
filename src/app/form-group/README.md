Form-Group folder implements the form functionality using Model driven approach

# Index.form-group.ts (i.e. Barrel)
This file contains the exports statement of files of current folder. This is to avoid cumbersome 
of large number of export statements.

# Form-Group/Shared
Here scss, services, module and route file of current feature is place to implement the lazy loading.
In turn form-group.module file is exported into the app.module.ts file
